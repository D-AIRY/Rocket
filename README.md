RocketMod is a free modular modding framework for game servers that is built on .NET technology.
Featuring a version for Unturned 3 and Eco, soon many more games will benefit from the RocketMod
ecosystem â€“ featuring plugins to customize game servers to their players needs.
RocketMod is easily installed and offers server owners completely new features like
translations, configurations, logging, permissions and more right out-of-the-box.

This repository contains the core components, the central issue tracker and wiki for the Rocket Plugin Framework.
RocketMod is available in version 4 (legacy) and version 5.
